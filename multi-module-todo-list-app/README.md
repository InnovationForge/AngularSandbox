# TO DO List Application

Intention is to create a simple to-do list application where users can add, edit, and mark tasks as complete. We can implement features like filtering tasks by status or due date. I am creating this app to learn few features of Angular.

## Application Features
1. Task Creation: Users can create new tasks by entering a title and optional details or notes. 
2. Task Management: Users can manage tasks by marking them as completed, deleting them, or editing their content. 
3. Task Priority: Users can set priorities for tasks, such as high, medium, or low, to help organize their workload. 
4. Due Dates and Reminders: Users can assign due dates to tasks and set reminders to receive notifications before the deadline. 
5. Task Categorization: Users can categorize tasks into different lists or categories (e.g., work, personal, shopping) for better organization. 
6. Search and Filters: The app may provide search functionality to find specific tasks quickly. It could also offer filters to view tasks based on priority, due date, or category. 
7. Sync Across Devices: If the app is available on multiple platforms, it may support syncing tasks across devices, ensuring users can access their to-do lists from anywhere. 
8. Collaboration: Some to-do list apps allow users to share tasks or lists with others, enabling collaborative task management. 
9. Recurring Tasks: Users can set tasks to repeat on specific intervals (daily, weekly, monthly) for recurring activities. 
10. Notifications: The app can send push notifications or reminders to users about upcoming tasks or deadlines. 
11. User Accounts: Optionally, the app may offer user account creation and login functionality to store tasks securely and provide a personalized experience. 
12. Data Backup: To prevent data loss, the app may offer data backup and restore options, ensuring users can retrieve their tasks if needed.

As we build a to-do list app, we can start with the core features and expand upon them based on the project requirements and creativity.

## Organizing features in components

Organizing your Angular app components is essential for maintaining a clean and scalable codebase. Below is a suggested way to structure your app components based on the features of a to-do list app:

1. App Component: This is the root component of your application. It will contain the main layout and navigation. 
2. Task List Component: This component will display the list of tasks. It will be responsible for fetching and displaying tasks, as well as handling interactions with individual tasks.
3. Task Item Component: This component represents an individual task within the list. It will handle displaying task details, such as title, description, due date, priority, and completion status. It should also handle task editing and deletion. 
4. Task Form Component: This component will be used to create and edit tasks. It will include input fields for title, description, due date, and priority. When editing a task, it can be displayed as a modal or a separate page.
5. Task Filter Component: This component will provide options to filter tasks based on criteria like priority, due date, or category. 
6. Task Search Component: This component will handle the search functionality, allowing users to search for specific tasks based on their titles or other attributes. 
7. Task Notification Component: This component will handle displaying notifications or reminders for upcoming tasks. 
8. Authentication Component: If your app supports user accounts and login functionality, you will need an authentication component responsible for user registration, login, and managing user sessions. 
9. Category Component: If you implement task categorization, you can create a component to manage and display different task categories. 
10. Task Service: This is a service that will handle fetching and managing the tasks. It will provide methods to interact with the backend API or local storage to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. 
11. Notification Service: This service will handle sending and managing notifications or reminders for tasks. 
12. User Service: If you have user authentication, this service will manage user-related data and interactions.

Remember that this is just one way to organize your components, and the actual structure might vary depending on the complexity of your app and your personal preferences. As your app grows, consider breaking components into smaller, reusable pieces to make maintenance easier. Additionally, using Angular's modules can help you organize your components and services into logical feature sets.

The components listed can be organized into logical groups or modules based on their functionalities. Grouping components together can help improve maintainability and reusability in your Angular app.

Here's how you can group them:

1. Task Module: This module will include components related to tasks, such as Task List, Task Item, Task Form, Task Filter, Task Search, and Task Notification. 
2. Authentication Module: If your app includes user authentication, you can create an Authentication module that contains the Authentication Component and related services. 
3. Category Module: If you implement task categorization, you can create a Category module that includes the Category Component and any related services. 
4. Shared Module: This module can contain components, directives, pipes, or other elements that are used across multiple modules. For example, you can place common UI components or services used by different parts of the app in the Shared module. 
5. Core Module: The Core module can include services that are essential for the app's core functionality. For example, the Task Service, Notification Service, and User Service can be part of the Core module.

By organizing components into modules, you can keep related functionalities together and make it easier to manage your codebase. It also enables you to load modules lazily, reducing the initial bundle size and improving app performance.

```css
src/
|-- app/
|   |-- shared/
|   |   |-- models/
|   |   |   |-- task.model.ts
|   |-- task/
|   |   |-- task-list/
|   |   |   |-- task-list.component.ts
|   |   |   |-- task-list.component.html
|   |   |   |-- task-list.component.css
|   |   |-- task-item/
|   |   |   |-- task-item.component.ts
|   |   |   |-- task-item.component.html
|   |   |   |-- task-item.component.css
|   |   |-- task-form/
|   |   |   |-- task-form.component.ts
|   |   |   |-- task-form.component.html
|   |   |   |-- task-form.component.css
|   |   |-- ... (other task-related components and files)
|   |   |-- task.module.ts
|   |   |-- task-routing.module.ts
|   |-- ...

```

Remember that Angular follows a modular architecture, and each module can have its own components, services, and other resources. When planning your app's organization, consider the separation of concerns, reusability, and how you want to encapsulate different features to create a scalable and maintainable application.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
